   <abstract>Product: 3D hydro flattened breaklines in SHP format.

    Geographic Extent: Northern, Central, and Southern Utah, covering approximately 10,450 square miles; partial coverage of 8 counties covering approximately 1,756 square miles in the Central Utah QL1 AOIs (Park City, Utah County, Wasatch Mountains, Western San Rafael Swell).

    Dataset Description: Utah 2018 Lidar project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of Lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.35 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), UTM Zone 12, meters and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), meters. Lidar data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed Classified LASv1.4 files formatted to 5065 individual 1,000 meter x 1,000 meter tiles; as tiled intensity imagery, as tiled bare-earth DEMs, and as tiled first-return DSMs, tiled with a mix of 1,000 meter x 1,000 meter and 2,000 meter x 2,000 meter schema (1604 tiles). Continuous breaklines were produced in ESRI shapefile format.

    Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in spring of 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the Lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Aero-Graphics, Inc. established a total of 29 ground control points that were used to calibrate the Lidar to known ground locations established throughout the AOI project area. An additional 479 independent accuracy checkpoints, 380 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (380 NVA points), 99 in the Shrubs category (99 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.</abstract>
   <purpose>To acquire detailed surface elevation data for use in conservation planning, design, research, floodplain mapping, dam safety assessments and elevation modeling, etc. Classified LAS files are used to show the manually reviewed bare earth surface. This allows the user to create intensity images, breaklines and raster DEMs and DSMs. The purpose of these Lidar data was to produce high accuracy 3D hydro-flattened digital elevation models (DEMs) with a 0.5 meter cell size. These raw Lidar point cloud data were used to create classified Lidar LAS files, intensity images, 3D breaklines, hydro-flattened DEMs, and first return DSMs as necessary.</purpose>

 <dataqual>
  <logic>Data covers the entire area specified for this project. Breaklines were collected in all inland ponds and lakes ~2 acres or greater. These features were flat and level water bodies at a single elevation for each vertex along the bank. The entire water surface edge is at or below the immediate surrounding terrain. Breaklines were collected for all streams and rivers ~100' nominal width or wider. These features are flat and level bank to bank, gradient will follow the surrounding terrain and the water surface will be at or below the surrounding terrain. Streams/river channels will break at culvert locations however not at elevated bridge locations. </logic>
  <complete>All files are inspected to ensure that they conform to the specified file naming conventions, all files load in their correct geographic position, all files conform to the project specifications for file standard and content.</complete>

    <procdesc>Hydro Flattening Breakline Processing: Class 2 (ground) lidar points were used to create a bare-earth surface model. The surface model was then used to heads-up digitize 2D breaklines of inland streams and rivers with a ~100 foot nominal width and Inland Ponds and Lakes of ~2 acres or greater surface area. Elevation values were assigned to all Inland Ponds and Lakes, Inland Pond and Lake Islands, Inland Stream and River Islands, using LP360 functionality. Elevation values were assigned to all Inland streams and rivers using LP360 functionality. All ground (ASPRS Class 2) lidar data inside of the collected inland breaklines were then classified to water (ASPRS Class 9) using LP360 functionality. A buffer of 0.35 meters was also used around each hydro-flattened feature. These points were moved from ground (ASPRS Class 2) to Ignored Ground (ASPRS Class 10). The breakline files were then translated to ESRI File-Geodatabase format using ESRI conversion tools. Breaklines are reviewed against lidar intensity imagery to verify completeness of capture. All breaklines are then compared to TINs (triangular irregular networks) created from ground only points prior to water classification. The horizontal placement of breaklines is compared to terrain features and the breakline elevations are compared to lidar elevations to ensure all breaklines match the lidar within acceptable tolerances. Some deviation is expected between breakline and lidar elevations due to monotonicity, connectivity, and flattening rules that are enforced on the breaklines. Once completeness, horizontal placement, and vertical variance is reviewed, all breaklines are reviewed for topological consistency and data integrity using a combination of ESRI Data Reviewer tools and proprietary tools.</procdesc>
