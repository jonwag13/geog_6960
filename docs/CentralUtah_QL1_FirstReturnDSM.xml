   <abstract>Product: First return Digital Surface Model (DSM) data.
    Geographic Extent: Northern, Central, and Southern Utah, covering approximately 10,450 square miles; partial coverage of 8 counties covering approximately 1,756 square miles in the Central Utah QL1 AOIs (Park City, Utah County, Wasatch Mountains, Western San Rafael Swell).

    Dataset Description: Utah 2018 Lidar project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of Lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.35 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), UTM Zone 12, meters and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), meters. Lidar data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed Classified LASv1.4 files formatted to 5065 individual 1,000 meter x 1,000 meter tiles; as tiled intensity imagery, as tiled bare-earth DEMs, and as tiled first-return DSMs, tiled with a mix of 1,000 meter x 1,000 meter and 2,000 meter x 2,000 meter schema (1604 tiles). Continuous breaklines were produced in ESRI shapefile format.

    Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in spring of 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the Lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Aero-Graphics, Inc. established a total of 29 ground control points that were used to calibrate the Lidar to known ground locations established throughout the AOI project area. An additional 479 independent accuracy checkpoints, 380in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (380 NVA points), 99 in the Shrubs category (99 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.</abstract>
   <purpose>To acquire detailed surface elevation data for use in conservation planning, design, research, floodplain mapping, dam safety assessments and elevation modeling, etc. Classified LAS files are used to show the manually reviewed bare earth surface. This allows the user to create intensity images, breaklines and raster DEMs and DSMs. The purpose of these Lidar data was to produce high accuracy 3D hydro-flattened digital elevation models (DEMs) with a 0.5 meter cell size. These raw Lidar point cloud data were used to create classified Lidar LAS files, intensity images, 3D breaklines, hydro-flattened DEMs, and first return DSMs as necessary.</purpose>

    <procdesc>First Return Raster DSM Processing: First return Lidar points were used to create a 0.5 meter first return raster DEM. Using LP360 along with automated scripting routines within ArcMap, TIF/TFW files were created for each tile. Each surface is reviewed using ESRI ArcMap and ArcScene to check for any surface anomalies or incorrect elevations found within the surface.</procdesc>
