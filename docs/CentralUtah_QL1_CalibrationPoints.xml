   <abstract>Product: Calibration Points collected for use in calibrating the 2018 Utah Lidar data and delivered in ESRI shapefile format.

    Geographic Extent: Northern, Central, and Southern Utah, covering approximately 10,450 square miles; partial coverage of 8 counties covering approximately 1,756 square miles in the Central Utah QL1 AOIs (Park City, Utah County, Wasatch Mountains, Western San Rafael Swell).

    Dataset Description: Utah 2018 Lidar project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of Lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.35 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), UTM Zone 12, meters and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), meters. Lidar data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed Classified LASv1.4 files formatted to 5065 individual 1,000 meter x 1,000 meter tiles; as tiled intensity imagery, as tiled bare-earth DEMs, and as tiled first-return DSMs, tiled with a mix of 1,000 meter x 1,000 meter and 2,000 meter x 2,000 meter schema (1604 tiles). Continuous breaklines were produced in ESRI shapefile format.

    Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in spring of 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the Lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Aero-Graphics, Inc. established a total of 29 ground control points that were used to calibrate the Lidar to known ground locations established throughout the AOI project area. An additional 479 independent accuracy checkpoints, 380 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (380 NVA points), 99 in the Shrubs category (99 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.</abstract>
   <purpose>To acquire detailed surface elevation data for use in conservation planning, design, research, floodplain mapping, dam safety assessments and elevation modeling, etc. Classified LAS files are used to show the manually reviewed bare earth surface. This allows the user to create intensity images, breaklines and raster DEMs and DSMs. The purpose of these Lidar data was to produce high accuracy 3D hydro-flattened digital elevation models (DEMs) with a 0.5 meter cell size. These raw Lidar point cloud data were used to create classified Lidar LAS files, intensity images, 3D breaklines, hydro-flattened DEMs, and first return DSMs as necessary.</purpose>
   <supplinf>State of Utah Contract No. AV2406 Contractor: Aero-Graphics, Inc. Lidar data were acquired and calibrated by Aero-Graphics, Inc. All follow-on processing was completed by the prime contractor.</supplinf>

    <procdesc>Calibration Control Point Processing: Control points were targeted and surveyed by Aero-Graphics, Inc. Control points were processed horizontally to NAD83(2011), UTM Zone 12, Meters and vertically to NAVD88(GEOID12B), meters. Please see the survey report for more information on control point coordinates and location methodologies. The calibration control point shapefiles were generated from XYZ text files using a combination of Global Mapper and ArcMap software.</procdesc>
