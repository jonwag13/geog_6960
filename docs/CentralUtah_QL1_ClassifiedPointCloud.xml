   <abstract>Product: These lidar data are processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to 5065 individual 1000 m x 1000 m tiles; used to create intensity images, 3D breaklines and hydro-flattened DEMs as necessary. 

    Geographic Extent: Northern, Central, and Southern Utah, covering approximately 10,450 square miles; partial coverage of 8 counties covering approximately 1,756 square miles in the Central Utah QL1 AOIs (Park City, Utah County, Wasatch Mountains, Western San Rafael Swell).

    Dataset Description: Utah 2018 Lidar project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of Lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.35 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), UTM Zone 12, meters and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), meters. Lidar data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed Classified LASv1.4 files formatted to 5065 individual 1,000 meter x 1,000 meter tiles; as tiled intensity imagery, as tiled bare-earth DEMs, and as tiled first-return DSMs, tiled with a mix of 1,000 meter x 1,000 meter and 2,000 meter x 2,000 meter schema (1604 tiles). Continuous breaklines were produced in ESRI shapefile format.

    Ground Conditions: Lidar was collected in spring of 2018, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the Lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Aero-Graphics, Inc. established a total of 29 ground control points that were used to calibrate the Lidar to known ground locations established throughout the AOI project area. An additional 479 independent accuracy checkpoints, 380 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (380 NVA points), 99 in the Shrubs category (99 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.</abstract>
   <purpose>To acquire detailed surface elevation data for use in conservation planning, design, research, floodplain mapping, dam safety assessments and elevation modeling, etc. Classified LAS files are used to show the manually reviewed bare earth surface. This allows the user to create intensity images, breaklines and raster DEMs and DSMs. The purpose of these Lidar data was to produce high accuracy 3D hydro-flattened digital elevation models (DEMs) with a 0.5 meter cell size. These raw Lidar point cloud data were used to create classified Lidar LAS files, intensity images, 3D breaklines, hydro-flattened DEMs, and first return DSMs as necessary.</purpose>
   <supplinf>State of Utah Contract No. AV2406 Contractor: Aero-Graphics, Inc. Lidar data were acquired and calibrated by Aero-Graphics, Inc. All follow-on processing was completed by the prime contractor.</supplinf>

  <complete>These LAS data files include all data points collected. No points have been removed or excluded. A visual qualitative assessment was performed to ensure data completeness. No void areas or missing data exist. The raw point cloud is of good quality and data passes Non-Vegetated Vertical Accuracy specifications.</complete>

    <procdesc>LAS Point Classification: The point classification is performed as described below. The bare-earth surface is manually reviewed to ensure correct classification on the Class 2 (Ground) points. After the bare-earth surface is finalized, it is then used to generate all hydro-breaklines through heads-up digitization. All ground (ASPRS Class 2) lidar data inside of the Lake Pond and River Pond hydro flattening breaklines were then classified to water (ASPRS Class 9) using LP360 functionality. A buffer of 0.35 meters was also used around each hydro-flattened feature to classify these ground (ASPRS Class 2) points to Ignored ground (ASPRS Class 10). All Lake Pond Island and River Stream Island features were checked to ensure that the ground (ASPRS Class 2) points were reclassified to the correct classification after the automated classification was completed. All overlap data was processed through automated functionality provided by TerraScan to classify the overlapping flight-line data to approved classes by USGS. The overlap data was classified using standard LAS overlap bit. These classes were created through automated processes only and were not verified for classification accuracy. All data was manually reviewed and any remaining artifacts removed using functionality provided by TerraScan and TerraModeler. Global Mapper is used as a final check of the bare-earth dataset. GeoCue was then used to create the deliverable industry-standard LAS files for the Classified Point Cloud Data. LAStools, LP360 and TerraScan software was used to perform statistical analysis of the classes in the LAS files, on a per tile level to verify classification metrics and full LAS header information.</procdesc>
