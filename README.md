Isotope Analysis of Timpanogos
==============================
My portion of a group research project which focused on analyzing heavy water isotopes collected from Mt Timpanogos, located in northern Utah.  Here I use a combination of geospatial, isotope, and climate datasets to visualize and model isotope patterns found in high mountain snowpack.

Python code for project is located in the src folder.
